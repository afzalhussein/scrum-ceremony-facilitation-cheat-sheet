### **FACILITATION PRO-TIPS**  
1. **Embrace Silence:** Pause 7-10 seconds after each question.  
2. **Pre-Write Questions:** Display them on a board to signal intentionality.  
3. **Anchor to Goals:** Always link to the event’s purpose (e.g., *“How does this serve our Sprint Goal?”*).  
4. **Name the Shift:** *“I’m asking open questions because your insights make us better.”*
